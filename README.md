1️⃣ Number Guessing Game (Random Number Generator)
This program generates a random number within a specified range (for example, 1 to 100) and asks the user to guess the number. The user enters their guess, and the program provides feedback indicating whether the guess is too high or too low. The process continues in a loop until the user correctly guesses the number. Once the correct guess is made, the program displays a congratulatory message and may also show the total number of attempts taken. This program helps in understanding random number generation, loops, conditional statements, and user input handling.

2️⃣ Basic Calculator Program
This program functions as a simple calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The user is prompted to enter two numbers and then select the desired operation. Based on the user’s choice, the program performs the selected calculation and displays the result. It also includes basic validation, such as preventing division by zero. This program demonstrates the use of conditional statements, operators, and user interaction in programming.

3️⃣ Tic-Tac-Toe Game (Console-Based)
This program is a console-based implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game designed for two players. The game uses a 3×3 grid as the playing board. Player 1 is assigned the symbol "X" and Player 2 is assigned the symbol "O". Players take turns entering the row and column numbers to place their symbol on the board. After each move, the program checks whether a player has won by forming a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line. If all spaces are filled without a winner, the game declares a draw. This program helps in understanding arrays, loops, conditional logic, functions, and game logic implementation.
